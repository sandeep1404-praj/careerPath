## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to server"
**Fix**: Make sure backend is running on port 5000
```powershell
cd backend
npm run server
```

### "Resumes not loading"
**Fix**: Check that:
1. You're logged in
2. Backend is connected to MongoDB
3. Check browser console for errors

### "Toast not showing"
**Fix**: Ensure `@/utils/toast.js` exists and is properly configured

### Routes not working
**Fix**: Make sure you've saved `App.jsx` with the new routes

### Styling looks broken
**Fix**: Ensure Tailwind CSS is configured and running
