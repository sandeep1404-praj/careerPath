## 🔧 Customization

### Changing Colors

In `ResumePreview.jsx`, the primary color is extracted from:
```javascript
const primaryColor = resume.template?.colorPalette?.[0] || '#3B82F6';
```

You can add a color picker in the editor to allow users to customize resume colors.

### Adding More Templates

Create additional preview templates by:
1. Duplicating the preview section in `ResumePreview.jsx`
2. Adding template selection in `ResumeEditor.jsx`
3. Storing template choice in `resume.template.theme`

### PDF Generation

To implement PDF download:
1. Install a PDF library: `npm install jspdf html2canvas` or `@react-pdf/renderer`
2. Add export function in `ResumePreview.jsx`
3. Convert the resume HTML to PDF

Example with jsPDF:
```javascript
import jsPDF from 'jspdf';
import html2canvas from 'html2canvas';

const handleDownload = async () => {
  const element = document.getElementById('resume-content');
  const canvas = await html2canvas(element);
  const imgData = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
  const pdf = new jsPDF('p', 'mm', 'a4');
  const imgWidth = 210;
  const imgHeight = (canvas.height * imgWidth) / canvas.width;
  pdf.addImage(imgData, 'PNG', 0, 0, imgWidth, imgHeight);
  pdf.save(`${resume.title}.pdf`);
};
```

## 🎯 Integration with User Context

The Resume Builder automatically uses the logged-in user's ID from `AuthContext`:

```javascript
const { user } = useAuth();
// user._id is used for API calls
```

All API calls include the JWT token from localStorage for authentication.

## 📱 Responsive Design

All components are fully responsive:
- Mobile: Single column layout
- Tablet: Two column grid for resume cards
- Desktop: Three column grid for resume cards

## 🐛 Error Handling

The module includes comprehensive error handling:
- API errors are caught and displayed via toast notifications
- Loading states for async operations
- Empty states for no data
- Validation for required fields
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## 🔐 Security

- All routes are protected with `ProtectedRoute`
- JWT token authentication for all API calls
- Backend validates user ownership of resumes
- No unauthorized access to other users' resumes
